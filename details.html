## Wedding Details

Please join us on <b>October 10, 2020</b> for our big day.

The ceremony is planned to start at 4:30PM, so please arrive and find a seat before that time.
The ceremony and reception will be held at the beautiful [Round Barn at Orrmont Farm](https://theroundbarnvenue.com/).
We plan to host the ceremony outdoors on the lawn by the trees. If the weather has nefarious plans that day,
the ceremony will be held inside the barn.

**Address**: [150 Fox Dr. Piqua, OH 45356]("https://www.google.com/maps/place/Round+Barn+at+Orrmont+Farm/@40.128621,-84.245389,12z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x1ea6a5a81724a97d!8m2!3d40.1226497!4d-84.2406205?hl=en-US")
