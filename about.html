# Our Story

### The Beginning

Derek and Krista first met when Krista came to interview for an internship at the company Derek was working for at the end of November in 2015.
Learning about each others education and technical interests, they connected instantly.
Things started to fall into place when Krista accepted the position at the company, and Derek was assigned to be her C++ guide and mentor.
After about a month of getting to know each other, Derek finally mustered the courage to ask her to see the new star wars movie on December 29th- Star Wars: The Force Awakens.
(Which we later learned, neither of us are particularly fond of the series- the fantasy genre is much more entertaining- but it made for a good first date).
We couldn't run out of things to talk about over fish & chips at the Pub, made it to the movie, and we couldn't let the night end there, so we wandered to the
Cheesecake factory for a late-night desert. 

Returning to work after the New Year's break, Krista had yet again forgotten to bring a lunch in (it was Sophomore year of college, and there was a lot going on, alright?).
Texting Derek of her woes, she arrived at work to find a cup of Star Wars kraft mac-n-cheese with a post-it note. The post-it note had the 14 digit reservation code for
their movie tickets from their first date (which they challenged eachother to memorize)- that's when she knew she found the one.

### The Middle

After 3.5 years of getting to know each other- meeting family and friends, going on a few trips, finishing 2 college degrees, and watching The Office way too many times, Derek
popped the question on July 27th, 2019. He was nervous as he planned a day to remember old and create new memories, but the height of the day was the picnic lunch at Charleston Falls Preserve in Tipp City- their favorite park. He surprised Krista with a full spread of fresh fruit, summer sausage, cheese and crackers, and sparkling juice at an empty picnic area of the park. Krista, who already had a hunch about where the day was going when Derek first arrived at her doorstep with flowers and chocolate, waited patiently while they made a dent in the decadent feast. With no one around but the armies of caterpillars that suddenly emerged, who must've sensed what was about to happen, Derek and Krista wandered around the grassy opening. Derek proposed on one knee just as the summer sun brightened through the canopy above. They spent the remainder of the afternoon walking around the park, flying kites, and later calling their friends and family to tell them the news.
